# Summary

# Statement of need

# Key references

`graph-pes` is driving a significant number of projects within the Deringer group, and has already been cited in `@Liu-24-12`.

The core functionality of `graph-pes` builds upon the
    - `PyTorch` `[@Paszke-19]`
    - `ase` `[@HjorthLarsen-17-06]`
`graph-pes` also builds upon the `e3nn` `[@Geiger-22-07]` package for implementing the `NequIP` `[@Batzner-22-05]` and `MACE` `[@Batatia-23-01]` architectures.

Other note-worthy softwares that offer similar functionality to `graph-pes` include:
- `nequip`
- `mace-torch`
- `deepmd`
- `schnetpack`
- `torchmd`
